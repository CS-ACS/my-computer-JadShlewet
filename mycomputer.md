## Commentary
* I really aprreciate and like my computer. This is mostly because I've had it for somewhere around 6 years, and it has never let me down, and I repay that favor by only dropping it like once a year. ðŸ˜€
* A bref description of how your computer's performance is affected by its hardware configuration (at least two of the aspects listed above) in a way that you can perceive as a user. For example, what kind of activities cause your computer to slow down and what do you think is the reason? Some activites that cause my computer to slow down are running too many programs at once and having bad Wi-Fi. Like for example, if I have too many programs open such as Google Chrome with tabs for homework for each of my 8 classes, and if I run some sort of game such as Fortnite, which I used to really enjoy, along with the Preview App, Notes, Home Design 3D, and more, then my laptop starts going really slow because of my 4GB RAM not having enough
