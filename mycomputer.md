## Commentary
* I really aprreciate and like my computer. This is mostly because I've had it for somewhere around 6 years, it has never let me down and has always been reliabe, and I try and repay that favor by almost never dropping it. ðŸ˜€
* My computer's performance is affected by its hardware configuration, especially Wi-Fi and CPU.  Some activites that cause my computer to slow down are running too many programs at once and doing something like writing an essay on Google Docs while having bad Wi-Fi and running other online programs. Like for example, if I have too many programs open such as Google Chrome with tabs for homework for each of my 8 classes, and if I run some sort of game such as Fortnite, which I used to really enjoy, along with the Preview App, Notes, Home Design 3D, and more, then my laptop starts going really slow because of my 8GB RAM not being able to keep up with all the programs as I switch between all of them, causing my computer to slowdown. My Intel Core i5 CPU also plays apart in this as it's the one that must move information into memory and retrieve data from it for the prgorams/applications that my laptop is running. Another occasion is when my Wi-Fi is being slow while I'm writing code like on here or an essay on google docs. This is because the text starts taking lots of time to appear on the screen and everything on my computer that uses Wi-Fi starts slowing down. So when I have bad Wi-Fi my computer slows down because the Wi-Fi at that moment cannot support all the online things that I'm doing, causing everything to slow down and/or take time to load.
